Brief:
	*Matlab Earth System Model (MESM)
	*A global model based on the shallow water equations of motion. 
	*Equations are implemented on a lat / lon grid, hence predictions at the poles are 
	 not possible without further development.
	*This model is designed as a learning tool, rather than for accurate predictions
	 to understand relationships between different aspect of the earth-system.
Running code:
	*run the code by opening MATLAB and typing the following at the MATLAB prompt:
	* >>shallow_water_sphere
	* when the model has finished running edit the plot_shallow_water_sphere.m file to 
	 decide which variable to plot (see plot1 variable). 
	 Your MATLAB installation will need to have the m_map toolbox installed 
	 (see https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html). 
	 If you use the Virtual Machine, provided for projects in SEES, you will not need to
	 install m_map. 
	 To start an example plot type:
	* >>plot_shallow_water_sphere
Using code:
    *The code has been put together for student projects. Your supervisor will discuss
     aspects of the model that might be of interest to your project, and how you might go
     about investigating them.
    *Please cite the original source of the code when using.
Example projects (as of 2017-09-08):
	*Compare dynamics between baroclinic and barotropic assumptions (via the Ripa system)
	*Test and evaluation a simplified radiation scheme and the models response to GHGs.
	*Implement bowen ratio and surface albedo data.
	*Understand the interaction between orography and dynamics
	*Test and implement cloud and precipitation schemes.
	*If interested you could use the model to look at transport of pollutants 
	(e.g. Fukushima, Icelandic Volcano)
